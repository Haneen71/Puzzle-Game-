Idea
The idea of our project is a game "IntelliQube" combines elements 
of intelligence (Intelli) and puzzle-solving (Qube). The name implies 
that the game is designed to challenge and assess the player's IQ 
level through various difficulty levels. The word "Qube" is a play on 
"cube," which represents the different stages or levels of the game. 
Overall, "IntelliQube" is a puzzle game that contains 6 different 
levels of difficulty to determine the player's IQ level.
